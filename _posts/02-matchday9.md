On 28 January 2023 me and my team had the first match of the second half of the season and the first official match of 2023. This match felt very important for our team, to recover a season that started with poor results and commitment despite our high ambitions. As for my self, this was the first match in which I fully recovered physically after my surgery. Performing well in this match meant a lot for me, because I had to rebuild confidence in my self and from my team mates.

# Game analysis

For this season my match reviews are essentially based on the parameters I outlined in my first blog post.

- _Game attitude_ : 8
- _Interaction with teammates_ : 8
- _Defensive phase_ : 7
- _Offensive concretization_ : 8
- _Technical Performance_: 9

The final grade is 8.1. In case you are wondering, this is not the plain average but a weighted one. The weights are introduced to reduce the importance of the technical performance, which is something that I care but that does not necessarily affect the impact I have on the game. For this reason every parameter weighs .225, while techincal performance weighs .1. Even this time the overall rating is aligned with how I intuitively rated the game: I had a solid rock performance, in which I provided for my team scoring two clutch goals (2-2 and the 7-6) and I made three assists for my teammates (3-2, 4-2). I run a lot and helped my team defensively being essentialy an extra defender, even though the first goal was entirely my mistake, since I lost the ball during a dribbling.

### Game attitude

Another time, one aspect that surpised during this match was my attitude towards the game, but in a different way from the previous match. If I have to find a sentence for my attidute during this match I'd say "a bit too much". Maybe it was the fact that I've stayed away from the football pitch for too much time, or my will to regain confidence, but my behaviour during the game was very rude and gritty, pretty unconvenitonal for a very relaxed and fluffy person like me. I think I am changing a lot during this period. Nevertheless, I did a good job in channeling all my feelings into drive to play with focus and a positive attitude. Moreover, this gritty attitude I applied helped me in winning most of the physical duels and tackles, that sometimes were very rude, in fact I also took a yellow card. Ultimately, I think that sometimes being a bit more rude if used with the correct approach can lead to positive results as happened today.

### Interaction with teammates

We played this game in our home pitch at Lisanza, a very short pitch in synthetic grass. In this pitch we play the ball by memory and with Alessandro (midfield) and Alberto (striker) I find myself playing with one or two touch creating good geometries. I feel that my will to connect better mentally with my teammates is paying off.

### Defensive phase

My defensive phase was very solid. As I already told the gritty attitude I applied to the game helped me in winning most of the tackles. My opponent on the left wing was very toguh, because he was very quick and had a very good right foot, but he was never dangerous since I've always been very good in closing the defensive diagonals and stop him when he tried to dribble past me, which happened just one time from many. I remained very focused when he had the ball and I did a very good job in maintaining stamina and pace during the course of the match to stop his change of directions. Moreover, I tried to poke (always without overdoing) a bit my opponent since I felt he was suffering the pressure, which payed off positively. Despite that, the first goal our oppents scored was entirely my fault, since I tried to dribble my opponent and lost the ball. Still, this game has been very open until the last seconds, with them being very good offensively and a lot of times my tackles were clutch.

### Offensive concretization

Finally, a game with a positive conversion rate. I've been seeking the goal for a long time and I finally found it. Honestly I seeked it not for personal satisfaction but for the sake of feeling useful and providing for my team with something even more concrete that simply a good performance. I have not much to say: in this match I had 3 clear cut chances, and I scored two of them. The remaining one was very difficult to score, since it was a counterjump week foot kick from a ball that was falling from a considerable height, which the opposing keeper saved with good reflexes. I also provided two assits. One thing that pleased me so much was that after the game the referee came to me just to compliment for my first goal. The end.

### Technical performance

Shooting, dribbling, crossing, first touch, weak foot, taking position with the body. Today everything felt so easy and natural. Sometimes I felt that I was undisputable. It has been an impeccable technical performance and I honestly have nothing to say. I am very pleased that all the hard work I did during this summer is paying off. Today during the warm-up I practiced some technical drills alone and I think it helped me to have a good feeling with the ball since the start of the game. I am looking forward to implement this drills in all my warmups.

# Final round

Finally a game in which I didn't simply played well but provided for my team with a good conversion rate of my chances. Honestly during this game I had so much fun beacuse the opponents were good, especially offensively, and we were able to win only in the late minutes of the second half, after I scored the 7-6 goal. I am very happy that my team is recovering from a very dark period and I hope that we can keep some consistency on our results. Let's go Lisanza üê∏!
