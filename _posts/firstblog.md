## Why

Exactly one year ago I decided to re-start playing footbal after almost 3 years of inactivity. Differently from the past, I opted for seven-a-side soccer. In this style of soccer ball mastery, which is something I never lacked but never mastered fully, becomes one of the aspects you need mostly to care about. Moreover, after 3 full years of football inactivity my weak foot, the left one, has become quite awful. On top of that, some of my teammates pointed out the fact that I tend to play too much on my own. As a icing on the cacke, my worst weakness was the finalization, in which I have always been terrible. That's why I played as a full back. On this past August and September I decided to start a journey to my weaknesses, here's what happend.

## Ball Mastery

Ball mastery refers to the ability of a player to master the ball in tight spaces with high frequency touches; the more your head is up, the better for your understanding of the game. Generally speaking, as a football player I never had to worry about my technique, that was discrete. I was not very tall and always relied more on my techical abilities that my muscles. However, after a long period of inactivity I needed to reinforce my abilities. For this reason I planned to do various exercises. For this purpose I searched on youtube various ball mastery drills and did them **every single day**. In less than 3 weeks I gained the same abilities I left 3 years ago, and I think they even improved further. Aside from ball mastery drills, juggling with a wall or alone with different kind of drills was a fantastic tool, that further improve my ball control and awareness. After my 3 weeks of improvements I started doing the drills with my head up most of the times, and noticed that also my in game performance improved. Not needing to care about the ball, because I mastered the touch, helped my scanning the pitch more and more, and find my teammatest and more connections with them.

## The weak foot

After three long years of inactivity my weak foot was left in the dust. I thought I had to restart by the basic drills but I was wrong. The situation was even worse. The main problem I noticed in the first days of working with my weak foot was the posture. Juggling or controlling the ball felt unnatural not only for my lack of sensibility on the foot, but also beacuse my posture when using the left foot was completely messed up. For this reason I started doing some postural drills, both with the ball and without it. After a month of not always consistent practing my posture was somewhat acceptable. From there I started working on my feet sensibility, doing ball mastery drills, simple juggling and very basic stuff. Kicking was another aspect in which the posture didn't help. Besides the annoying part of finding a place where I could freely kick in my awesome town, I started practicing with simple drills to build strength in my leg and inguinal muscles, which hurted a lot.

## Finalization

Finalization was the hardest exercise to set up. Firstly, as already said in my town, or near towns, there were no free football fields with a net on the goal. In addtion, I had not tools aside for my backpack and some shirts to emulate the cones. Finally I found I place where I could kick: a net in fron of a nursery ðŸ˜…. My plan was to improve in the finalization patterns that happens the most for my position and style of play. As a left side in 7-as football, the most common type of kicks were the curve shot with my right and the cross shoot with my left; then, since, I like going on the center of the pitch to find a quick triangle and shoot, I tried some drills to improve finalization from the center of the pitch. Longshots were not included since I don't think are necessary a weak point. My drills were very simple and very frustrating: the base idea was to make the drills as game realistic as possible, which was very difficult given the tools I had. Before every drill I put cones near the post to shrink the range of valid shoots. For the two first type of drills I used to do some ball mastery exercises and then dribble a cone and shoot as fast as I could. For the center type of drills I used to touch the ball as fast as I can and then when a random timer rang, I will shoot from wherever I was.

## Something I forgot about

Guys, the mind: probably my worst aspect. I lack confidence. A lot. I didn't work on that too much this summer, and I think this aspect can screw my goals if I don't work on it properly. My mind seems weaker also when I play amateur football competitively. Something that happens in football that I can't understand is that it seems that every one can talk to anyone. I played football at good levels (never professional) for at least 8 years. I had discrete coaches, and I think i learned a lot. I still don't belive I can talk too much in front of other more experienced players. For me it's respect. When I am not treated objectively, or when my teammates don't try to be constructive and talk about what I'm doing wrong instead of complaining about all sorts of things, I completely throw away my game. There's a recent trend on me that started this spring: whenever I fail a goal, I listen people chattering behind my back. From this summer it's not even chatter anymore, before even kicking people seem to already complain that I will not score, or doubt I will do it. The problem is that no one told me anything about how to proactively enhance my finalization skills. As a person that lacks in confidence in general, this screws me a lot. But it also don't help to form bonds with my teammates, especially ones that I think I can have a good bond with.
I don't want to sound as a victim, so I will set new goals to improve my mind. Maybe I will also talk with some of my teammates to help them understand my point of view, and what I would like them to do about me.

## My new goals

Skill wise I think I am above average in the amateur championship I am playing on. Finalization is still bad. The bond with my teammates is increasing in terms of feeling and passing during the game. My left side role is strange, because in some games I act almost as a forward, in others a 3rd center back. So my objectives for this season is to improve my score sheet of +5 goals, with the finaliation drills and mind work I will put on. I want to maximize the bond with my teammates and start playing very well with other players. I would like to do more assits and more defensive work when it's needed and provide as much as I can for my team. Finally, I want to build a strong mind building confidence and playing as a mature player.

My idea is to post my game analysys every time I will finish a match. So if my free time will allow it, stay tuned!
